FILES TO UPLOAD TO HOSTINGER FILE MANAGER
==========================================

After uploading chat.php, upload these files:

1. FROM: dist/assets/index-2a0d8ee6.js
   TO: public_html/assets/index-2a0d8ee6.js
   (DELETE OLD: public_html/assets/index-85d8cd2f.js)

2. FROM: dist/assets/main-88058510.js
   TO: public_html/assets/main-88058510.js
   (DELETE OLD: public_html/assets/main-582229d4.js)

3. FROM: dist/assets/main.ee983d64.css
   TO: public_html/assets/main.ee983d64.css
   (REPLACE existing file)

4. FROM: dist/index.html
   TO: public_html/index.html
   (REPLACE existing file - this updates the script reference)

SUMMARY:
- Upload 3 files to /public_html/assets/
- Upload 1 file to /public_html/
- Delete 2 old JS files from /public_html/assets/

These files contain the fixed chat support code that prevents zeros from showing.
